# BasicOperation
An extensible base class for all iOS Operations in Swift 4.2

I've been fighting many weeks to get my base class of iOS operations right, so if anyone wants to make use of it feel free.

I don't care about credits etc, use at will, copy, modify do what you want with it.

PS: Heavily inspired by the WWDC 2015 talk "Advanced NSOperations", from the amazing Dave DeLong.
